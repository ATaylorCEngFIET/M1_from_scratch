DPIR-1#1 Warning
Asynchronous driver check  
DSP design_1_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/u_cortexm1/u_core/u_dp/u_mul_shft/u_mul/nxt_mult_out0 input pin design_1_i/CORTEXM1_AXI_0/inst/u_cortexm1/u_core/u_dp/u_mul_shft/u_mul/nxt_mult_out0/A[0] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.

It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
